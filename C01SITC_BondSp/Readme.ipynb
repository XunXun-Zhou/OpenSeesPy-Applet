In these cases, the bond slip associated with strain penetration typically occurs along a portion of the anchorage length. This model can also be applied to the beam end regions, where the strain penetration may include slippage of the bar along the entire anchorage length, but the model parameters should be chosen appropriately.\n",

    "The zero-length section element in OpenSees is assumed to have ***a unit length*** such that the element deformations (i.e., elongation and rotation) are equal to the section deformations (i.e., axial strain and curvature). The material model for the steel fibers in the zero-length section element represents the bar slip instead of strain for a given bar stress. The uniaxial material model Bond_SP01 is developed for steel fibers in the zero-length section elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the model proposed for the steel fibers, a material model describing the monotonic response and hysteretic rules is also required for the concrete fibers. The combination of using the zero-length section element and enforcing the plane section assumption at the end of a flexural member impose **high deformations to the extreme concrete fibers in the zero-length element**. These deformations would likely correspond to concrete compressive strains significantly greater than the strain capacity stipulated by typical confined concrete models. Such high compressive strains at the end of flexural members are possible because of additional confinement effects expected from the adjoining members and because of complex localized deformation at the member end. Without further proof, it is suggested that the concrete fibers in the zero-length section element follow a concrete model in OpenSees. **To accommodate the large deformations expected to the extreme concrete fibers in the zero-length element, this concrete model may be assumed to follow a perfectly plastic behavior once the concrete strength reduces to 80% of the confined compressive strength**. A parametric study has indicated that the simulation results would not be very sensitive to the compressive strain chosen to trigger the perfectly plastic behavior for the concrete fibers in the zero-length section element."
